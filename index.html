            <p>I'm a passionate and curious student hailing from the archipelago of Indonesia. My journey of exploration and learning is fueled by a deep appreciation for the modern world and its technology

            When I'm not buried in textbooks or scribbling down notes, you'll often find me immersing myself in the mesmerizing world of programming.
                
            I believe that the power of education lies in its ability to create bridges between people. With every step I take in my academic pursuits, I'm on a mission to contribute to the world's future in technology.

        <p>As a teenage kid, I have a wide list of hobbies, the main one being coding and gaming. Due to my lack of social skills, I don't see myself engaging in social activities much, as I spend most of my free time indoors. This leads to me being introduced to both said hobbies.</p>

            <p>Coding has been my hobby for quite some time. Its gives me satisfaction whenever I get things right and as I improve I grow aware of how vast the world of programming is. Whether I'm crafting a sleek website, tinkering with interactive apps, or unraveling the mysteries of algorithms, coding is my way of painting a portrait of innovation.
